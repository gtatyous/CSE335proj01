All code written by A and B

NETIDs: A and B

A implemented the Bubble Tea class and its member functions. B wrote the Orange Juice class and its member functions. Both of us discussed the implementation of the base Drink class and the size_to_string function.

The base class Drink is abstract and provides an interface to print OrangeJuice and BubbleTea objects. Bubble Tea and Orange Juice can be created using the regular constructor or copy constructor. Assignment and construction of same-type objects is allowed with both lvalue and rvalue arguments. A virtual member function ConfirmOrder() can be called on BubbleTea and OrangeJuice objects to print out their data members in the form of restaurant orders.
